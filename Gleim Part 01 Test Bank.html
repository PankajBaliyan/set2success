The repurchase of treasury stock reduces total equity by $200,000 (50,000 shares &#215; $4); however, the subsequent reissuance increases total equity by $300,000 (50,000 shares &#215; $6).

The lender (buyer) likewise reduces the bond premium (by a credit) for the excess of cash interest received over interest income recognized. Interest paid (received) is a cash outflow (inflow) from an operating activity. In a reconciliation of net income to net cash flow from operating activities, both the issuer of the bond and the purchaser must make an adjustment for the difference between the cash flow and the effect on net income. Because the issuer&#8217;s cash outflow exceeded interest expense, it must deduct the difference (premium amortization) from net income in performing the reconciliation. The purchaser&#8217;s cash inflow is greater than interest income, so it must add the difference (premium amortization) to net income to arrive at net cash flow from operating activities.' },

Financial reporting provides information about an enterprise&#8217;s performance during a period when it was under the direction of a particular management but does not directly provide information about that management&#8217;s performance.

Adjusting this amount for noncash items yields the net cash provided by operations. Depreciation is a noncash expense that should be added. To adjust for the difference between cost of goods sold and purchases, the inventory decrease is added (COGS exceeded purchases). To adjust for the difference between purchases and cash paid to suppliers, the increase in accounts payable is also added (purchases exceeded cash paid to suppliers). The increase in accounts receivable is subtracted because it indicates that accrued revenues were greater than cash collections. Finally, the increase in accrued liabilities is added. Thus, the net cash provided by operations is $3,450 ($2,750 + $500 + $100 + $250 &#8211; $200 + $50).' },

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (B) is correct.</div> The cost of an acquired entity minus the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized. However, goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit that benefited from the business combination for the purpose of testing impairment. Testing occurs each year at the same time, but different reporting units may be tested at different times. Furthermore, additional testing also may be indicated. Potential impairment of goodwill is deemed to exist only if the carrying amount (including goodwill) of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value. Thus, accounting for goodwill is based on the units of the combined entity into which the acquired entity was absorbed. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one of its components, that is, one level below an operating segment. A component qualifies as a reporting unit if (1) it is a business for which discrete financial information is available, and (2) segment management regularly reviews its operating results. However, similar components are aggregated.

Permanent differences have no deferred tax effects.

This temporary difference gives rise to a future taxable amount, specifically, a $400,000 deferred tax liability ($1,000,000 &#215; 40%).

Using the adjusted market assessment approach, an entity evaluates the market in which it sells goods or services and estimates the price that a customer in that market would be willing to pay for them.

The difference in cost divided by the difference in activity is the variable rate. Once the variable rate is found, the fixed portion is determinable. The difference in production is 1,000 units (6,000 Week 2 &#8211; 5,000 Week 1), and the difference in the total cost (TC) for both weeks is $5,500 [($19,500 + $28,000 Week 2) &#8211; ($17,000 + $25,000 Week 1)]. Hence, the unit variable cost (VC) is $5.50 ($5,500 &#247; 1,000 units). The total variable costs for Week 1 must have been $27,500 (5,000 units &#215; $5.50 VC per unit), and the fixed cost must therefore have been $14,500 ($42,000 TC &#8211; $27,500 VC).' },

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> First, it is necessary to find the actual amount of materials used in each unit of finished good, including the evaporated material. Since 4% of the total amount evaporates, an equation can be set up as X oz &#215; 96% = 9 oz. The variable X is 9.375 oz, which is the amount of raw materials input for one unit of finished goods. The evaporated material should be counted since it is normal spoilage, which is spoilage that occurs under normal operating conditions. Normal spoilage conditions are absorbed into the cost of the finished good.<br>The cost per ounce of raw materials is $2.20. This contains the cost to ship each ounce of materials. Any cost necessary to get the material to the production process is included in the cost of direct materials.

Accordingly, normal spoilage is assigned to all good units in process costing systems, that is, all units that have passed the inspection point at which the spoilage was detected. If normal spoilage is attributable to a specific job, only the disposal value of the normally spoiled goods is removed from work-in-process, thereby assigning the cost of normal spoilage to the good units remaining in the specific job. Abnormal spoilage is not expected to occur under normal, efficient operating conditions. The cost of abnormal spoilage should be separately identified and reported.

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (A) is correct.</div> Absorption costing results in a higher income figure than variable costing whenever production exceeds sales because absorption costing capitalizes some fixed factory overhead as part of inventory. These costs are expensed during the period incurred under variable costing. Consequently, variable costing recognizes greater expenses and lower income when production exceeds sales. The reverse is true when sales exceed production. In that case, the absorption method results in a lower income because some fixed costs of previous periods absorbed by the beginning inventory are expensed in the current period as cost of goods sold. Variable costing income is never burdened with fixed costs of previous periods.' },

Under absorption costing, the fixed portion of manufacturing overhead is included in the cost of each product.

The rate for assigning fixed overhead costs is $2 per unit ($600,000 budgeted fixed overhead costs &#247; 300,000 budgeted production units).

In April, under absorption costing, $4,000 ($2 fixed overhead rate per unit &#215; 2,000 units produced and not sold) of fixed manufacturing overhead costs were still embedded in ending inventory and were not expensed. Under variable costing, these fixed manufacturing overhead costs of $4,000 were expensed.

Dividing the $17,000 of conversion costs by 8,500 equivalent units results in a unit cost of $2 per bat. Therefore, the total cost of goods transferred out would be $5.30, consisting of $3.30 for materials and $2 for conversion costs. Multiplying $5.30 times the 8,000 bats completed results in a total transfer of $42,400.

Further processing of R, which is salable at split-off, is not economical because the cost of $150,000 exceeds the benefit [2,500 units &#215; ($150 &#8211; $100) = $125,000]. Thus, R&#8217;s NRV is $250,000 (2,500 units &#215; $100 price at split-off). However, S and T must be processed further. S&#8217;s NRV is $425,000 [(5,000 units &#215; $115) &#8211; $150,000], and T&#8217;s NRV is $125,000 [(7,500 units &#215; $30) &#8211; $100,000]. Given that the NRV of T is a reduction of joint cost, the total joint cost to be allocated is therefore $595,000 ($720,000 &#8211; $125,000 NRV of T).

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (C) is correct.</div> The most important factor in budgeting manufacturing overhead is production volume. Many overhead items have variable costs, and those that are fixed with a relevant range of output may increase if production exceeds that range. The other essential consideration is management&#8217;s judgment with respect to the nature and amount of costs to be incurred and expectations for production volume. Because overhead is applied based on predetermined rates, accurate judgment is important.' },

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> Allocating overhead on the basis of the number of units produced is usually not appropriate. Costs should be allocated on the basis of some plausible relationship between the cost object and the incurrence of the cost, preferably cause and effect. The fixed portion of overhead costs is incurred regardless of the level of production. When multiple products are involved, the number of units of production may bear no relationship to the incurrence of the allocated cost. If overhead is correlated with machine hours but different products require different quantities of that input, the result may be an illogical allocation. However, if a firm manufactures only one product, this allocation method may be acceptable because all costs are to be charged to the single product.' },

However, no reciprocal allocations among service departments are performed. The process usually begins with the department that provides the greatest percentage of its services to other service departments. Thus, the Repair Department is the logical starting point. Given that service costs are allocated to each department (service or production) on the basis of its proportion of employees (excluding employees in the allocating department), the allocation of the Repair Department&#8217;s overhead to the Tool Department is $875 {[1 employee &#247; (1 + 2 + 25 + 12)] &#215; $35,000}.' },

These costs are allocated to other service departments as well as to users. The process usually begins with the service department that renders the greatest percentage of its services to other service departments.

The total of the Building Operations costs to be allocated to production equals $670,000 ($550,000 + $120,000). The allocation base will be 40,000 square feet because no costs are allocated back to Information Services.

One common assumption in a learning curve model is that the cumulative average time (and labor cost) per unit is reduced by a certain percentage each time production doubles. Given a $120 cost per unit for the first 100 units and a $72 cost per unit when cumulative production doubled to 200 units, the learning curve percentage must be 60% ($72 &#247; $120). If production is again doubled to 400 units (four batches), the average unit labor cost should be $43.20 ($72 &#215; 60%). Hence, total labor cost for 400 units is estimated to be $17,280 (400 units &#215; $43.20).' },

Materials costs are strictly variable and should remain proportional to production. The labor ($8,500) and variable overhead ($4,000) costs (labor-related), however, will be affected by the learning curve. The average cost per lot for labor and variable overhead after 100 units have been produced should be 80% of the costs of the first lot of 50 units. Thus, the average labor and variable overhead cost per 50-unit lot will be $10,000 ($12,500 &#215; 80%).<br> If production doubles again (to a total production of 200 units or four lots of 50 each), the cumulative average cost for labor and variable overhead will be $8,000 per lot ($10,000 &#215; 80%). Given four lots of 50 each, at an average cost of $8,000 per lot, the total cost for labor and variable overhead must be $32,000. Adding $6,000 for raw materials ($1,500 per 50-unit lot) gives a total variable cost of $38,000 for 200 units. Fixed overhead is 10% of total variable cost, so total cost is $41,800.

Using the information given, it can be determined that the profit will be $20 when the supply is 4 units. It is also evident that the profit is zero when the supply is zero. The expected profit must also be calculated for supply levels of 2 and 6 units. For a supply of 2 units, the expected profit is<div class="TblScrl"><table><tr><td>.1(&#8211;$80) + .3($40) + .4($40)+ .2($40) = $28</td></tr></table></div>For a supply of 6 units, the expected loss is<div class="TblScrl"><table><tr><td>.1(&#8211;$240) + .3(&#8211;$120) + .4($0) + .2($120) = $(36)</td></tr></table></div>Thus, without perfect information, profits are maximized at $28 when the supply is 2 units. However, with perfect information, profits will be $68. Thus, a rational seller should therefore be willing to pay up to $40 ($68 &#8211; $28).' },

Competitors find it difficult to acquire the firm&#8217;s customers, for example, by price cutting. The reason is that the firm&#8217;s products are perceived to have few substitutes, and brand loyalty is high. Furthermore, barriers to entry are favorable to the firm. These barriers deter competitors from entering the market. Existing firms can increase market share and emphasize cutting costs and increasing value.' },

It includes an analysis of the five competitive forces that determine long-term profitability measured by long-term return on investment. This analysis results in an evaluation of the attractiveness of an industry. The five forces are (1) the degree of rivalry among existing firms; (2) threats of, and barriers to, entry; (3) the threat of substitute products or services; (4) the threat of buyers&#8217; bargaining power; and (5) the threat of suppliers&#8217; bargaining power.' },

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> The most favorable condition for the attractiveness of an industry is the existence of high entry barriers and low exit barriers. When the threat of new entrants is minimal and exit is not difficult, returns are high, and risk is reduced in the event of poor performance. Low entry barriers keep long-term profitability low because new firms can enter the industry, increasing competition and lowering prices and the market shares of existing firms. Exit barriers are reasons for a firm to remain in an industry despite poor (or negative) profits.' },

A budget is also a control tool because it establishes standards and facilitates comparison of actual and budgeted performance. Because a budget establishes standards and accountability, it motivates good performance by highlighting the work of effective managers. Moreover, the nature of the budgeting process fosters communication of goals to company subunits and coordination of their efforts. Budgeting activities by entities within the company must be coordinated because they are interdependent. Thus, the sales budget is a necessary input to the formulation of the production budget.

Advantages of a participative budget include greater accuracy of budget estimates. Managers with immediate operational responsibility for activities have a better understanding of what results can be achieved and at what costs.

The inventory of bicycles is expected to decline from 2,150 to 900, a decrease of 1,250 units. Subtracting this inventory decline from the 130,000 units of projected sales results in expected production of 128,750 units. Given that each tricycle and bicycle requires two units of A19, the necessary units of the component can be calculated by adding the 96,200 tricycles to the 128,750 bicycles, a total production of 224,950. Multiplying this total production level times the two components required results in a total of 449,900 components. Combining the 449,900 units of A19 needed for production with the desired inventory decrease of 1,500 units (3,500 &#8211; 2,000) indicates that 448,400 components must be purchased.

Therefore, total cash inflows projected for the month of October equal $100,000 + $30,000 + $140,000 = $270,000.

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> The net change in expected cash receipts and disbursements may be determined by adjusting the net loss. The purchase of equipment on credit does not affect cash or the net loss. Depreciation expense and the accrual of an estimated warranty liability are noncash expenses that are added back to the net loss. The net loss should also be adjusted for the difference between cost of sales (included in the determination of the net loss) and cash paid to suppliers. This adjustment requires two steps: (1) The difference between cost of sales and purchases equals the change in inventory, and (2) purchases must have exceeded cash paid to suppliers because accounts payable increased. Given that inventory is not expected to change, cost of sales exceeds the cash to be paid to suppliers by the amount of the increase in accounts payable. The increase must be added back to the net loss. A decrease in accounts receivable means that cash collections exceeded sales. Accordingly, this decrease is also added back to the net loss. The expected increase in cash position is $54,000 [$(120,000) net loss + $42,000 depreciation + $12,000 warranty liability + $48,000 increase in accounts payable + $72,000 decrease in accounts receivable].' },

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (A) is correct.</div> The choice of practical rather than master budget capacity as the denominator level will result in a lower absorption costing net income. Practical capacity is the maximum level at which output is produced efficiently, with an allowance for unavoidable interruptions, for example, for holidays and scheduled maintenance. Because this level will be higher than master-budget (expected) capacity, its use will usually result in the underapplication of fixed overhead. For example, given costs of $100,000 and master-budget capacity of 800,000 units, $.125 per unit is the application rate. If practical capacity is 1,250,000 units, the application rate is $.08 per unit. If actual production is 800,000 units, fixed overhead will not be over- or underapplied given the use of master-budget capacity. However, there will be $36,000 (450,000 units &#215; $.08) of underapplied fixed overhead if practical capacity is the denominator level. Consequently, given that the beginning inventory is zero and that production exceeded sales, less fixed overhead will be inventoried at the lower practical capacity rate than at the master-budget rate. Thus, master-budget net income will be greater.' },

A DRG is a patient classification scheme in which hospitals are regarded as multiproduct firms with inpatient treatment procedures related to the numbers and types of patient ailments treated. MVH has developed standard nursing times for the treatment of each DRG classification, and nursing labor hours are assumed to vary with the number of DRGs treated within a time period. The nursing unit on the fourth floor treats patients with four DRG classifications. The unit is staffed with registered nurses (RNs), licensed practical nurses (LPNs), and aides.

It is the difference between budgeted fixed overhead and the amount applied based on a predetermined rate and the standard input allowed for actual output. It measures the use of capacity rather than specific cost outlays. The predetermined rate equals the budgeted overhead divided by a measure of capacity. Consequently, when the standard input allowed for actual output exceeds the budgeted capacity, fixed overhead is overapplied, and the volume variance is favorable. If the master budget capacity is the denominator value, the volume variance is unfavorable. Conversely, when the standard input allowed for actual output is less than the budgeted capacity, fixed overhead is underapplied, and the volume variance is unfavorable.

   ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (B) is correct.</div> The total overhead applied was $1,400,000 ($1,200,000 fixed plus $200,000 variable). Since actual overhead was $1,600,000, the total overhead variance was $200,000 unfavorable. The $200,000 total variance would be explained by three elements: the fixed overhead volume variance, the variable overhead efficiency variance, and the total spending variance. At $3 per hour, fixed overhead was applied on the basis of 400,000 hours ($1,200,000 applied fixed overhead &#247; $3 per labor hour). But since the budget called for 500,000 hours ($1,500,000 budgeted fixed overhead &#247; $3 per labor hour), there was an unfavorable volume variance of 100,000 hours at $3, or $300,000. The variable overhead efficiency variance is calculated by multiplying the excess hours of 30,000 (430,000 &#8211; 400,000) times the variable application rate of $.50, or $15,000 unfavorable. Therefore, when you combine the $300,000 unfavorable volume variance and the $15,000 unfavorable efficiency variance, you get $315,000 unfavorable. Since the total variance was only $200,000 unfavorable, the spending variance must be favorable in the amount of $115,000. Algebraically, this is solved as $300,000 U + 15,000 U &#8211; SV = 200,000 U. Thus SV = $115,000 F.' },

Accordingly, $980,000 of selling expenses and $425,000 of actual fixed administrative expenses were expensed during the year. The fixed manufacturing costs must be calculated after giving consideration to the increase in inventory during the period (some fixed costs were capitalized) and to the underapplied overhead. The beginning finished goods inventory included 35,000 units, each of which had absorbed $5 of fixed manufacturing overhead. Each unit produced during the year also absorbed $5 of fixed manufacturing overhead. Given that 125,000 of those units were sold, cost of goods sold was debited for $625,000 of fixed overhead (125,000 units &#215; $5). At year end, the underapplied overhead was also added to cost of goods sold. Because production was expected to be 140,000 units, the overhead application rate for the $700,000 of planned fixed manufacturing overhead was $5 per unit. Only 130,000 units were manufactured. Hence, $650,000 (130,000 units &#215; $5) of overhead was applied to units in process. Because inventory increased from 35,000 to 40,000 units (35,000 BI + 130,000 produced &#8211; 125,000 sold), $25,000 (5,000-unit increase &#215; $5) of the applied fixed manufacturing overhead for the period was inventoried, not expensed.

To stem the slide in profits until new products can be introduced, an incentive program has been developed to reward production managers who contribute to an increase in the number of units produced and effect cost reductions.<br>The managers have responded to the pressure of improving manufacturing in several ways. The video game machines are put together by the Assembly Group which requires parts from both the Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and the Reading Heads (RH) groups. To attain increased production levels, the PCB and RH groups commenced rejecting parts that previously would have been tested and modified to meet manufacturing standards. Preventive maintenance on machines used in the production of these parts has been postponed with only emergency repair work being performed to keep production lines moving.<br>The more aggressive Assembly Group production supervisors have pressured maintenance personnel to attend to their machines at the expense of other groups. This has resulted in machine downtime in the PCB and RH groups that, when coupled with demands for accelerated parts delivery by the Assembly Group, has led to more frequent parts rejections and increased friction among departments.<br>Funtime operates under a standard cost system.

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposes many requirements on management, boards of directors, and auditors. Section 404 deals with internal controls and reports thereon. It requires management to establish and document internal control procedures and to include in their annual reports a report on the company&#8217;s internal control over financial reporting. The report is to include a statement of management&#8217;s responsibility for internal control, management&#8217;s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control as of the end of the most recent fiscal year, identification of the framework used to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control (such as the COSO report), and a statement that the external auditor has issued an attestation report on management&#8217;s assessment. Because of this requirement, there are two audit opinions: one on internal control and one on the financial statements. Section 301 does address activities of the audit committee, but it contains no requirement that the audit committee approve the choice of accounting policies and practices. Section 204 states that the auditor must report to the audit committee all critical accounting policies and practices, alternative treatments of information discussed with management, implications of the alternatives, and the treatment preferred by the auditor.' },

The control environment component of internal control reflects the attitude and actions of the board and management regarding the significance of control within the organization. It sets the organization&#8217;s tone and influences the control consciousness of personnel. Moreover, the control environment provides discipline and structure for the achievement of the primary objectives of internal control. The control environment includes, among other elements, integrity and ethical values. Thus, standards should be effectively communicated, e.g., by management example. Management also should remove incentives and temptations for dishonest or unethical acts.' },

 ' A. Requiring two persons to open mail.',
 ' B. Reconciling the accounts receivable subsidiary file with the control account.',
 ' C. Using batch totals.',
 ' D. Preparing bank reconciliations.'

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (A) is correct.</div> Preventive controls are designed to prevent an error or an irregularity. Detective and corrective controls attempt to identify and correct errors or irregularities that have already occurred. Preventive controls are usually more cost beneficial than detective or corrective controls. Assigning two individuals to open mail is an attempt to prevent misstatement of cash receipts.' },

 ' B. Corrective.',
 ' C. Detective.',
 ' D. Directive.'
 ], answer:1, notID:2057, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (A) is correct.</div> A prelisting of cash receipts in the form of checks is a preventive control. It is intended to deter undesirable events from occurring. Because fraud involving cash is most likely to occur before receipts are recorded, either remittance advices or a prelisting of checks should be prepared in the mail room so as to establish recorded accountability for cash as soon as possible. A cash register tape is a form of prelisting for cash received over the counter. One copy of a prelisting will go to accounting for posting to the cash receipts journal, and another is sent to the cashier for reconciliation with checks and currency received.' },

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> One person should not be responsible for all phases of a transaction, i.e., for authorization, recording, and custodianship of the related assets. These duties should be performed by separate individuals to reduce the opportunities for any person to be in a position of both perpetrating and concealing errors or fraud in the normal course of his or her duties. For instance, an employee who receives and lists cash receipts should not be responsible for comparing the recorded accountability for cash with existing amounts.' },

 ' D. Post the receipts to the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger cards.'
 ], answer:4, notID:2059, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> The cashier is an assistant to the treasurer and thus performs an asset custody function.

 options:[
 ' A. Signing of paychecks and custody of blank payroll checks.',
 ' B. Preparation of paychecks and check distribution.',
 ' C. Approval of time cards and preparation of paychecks.',
 ' D. Timekeeping and preparation of payroll journal entries.'
 ], answer:4, notID:2061, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> Combining the timekeeping function and the preparation of the payroll journal entries would not be improper because the employee has no access to assets or to employee records in the personnel department. Only through collusion could an embezzlement be perpetrated. Accordingly, the functions of authorization, recordkeeping, and custodianship remain separate.' },

  { id:2062, q:'Auditors document their understanding of internal control with questionnaires, flowcharts, and narrative descriptions. A questionnaire consists of a series of questions concerning controls that auditors consider necessary to prevent or detect errors and fraud. The most appropriate question designed to contribute to the auditors&#8217; understanding of the completeness of the expenditure (purchases-payables) cycle concerns the',
 options:[
 ' A. Internal verification of quantities, prices, and mathematical accuracy of sales invoices.',
 ' B. Use and accountability of prenumbered checks.',
 ' C. Disposition of cash receipts.',
 ' D. Qualifications of accounting personnel.'
 ], answer:2, notID:2062, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (B) is correct.</div> A completeness assertion concerns whether all transactions and accounts that should be presented in the financial statements are so presented. The exclusive use of sequentially numbered documents facilitates control over expenditures. An unexplained gap in the sequence alerts the auditor to the possibility that not all transactions have been recorded. A failure to use prenumbered checks would therefore suggest a higher assessment of control risk. If a company uses prenumbered checks, it should be easy to determine exactly which checks were used during a period.' },

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> Allowing a sales department to approve a credit memo without a receiving report would be dangerous. Sales personnel could overstate sales in one period and then reverse them in subsequent periods. Thus, a copy of the receiving report for returned goods should be sent to the billing department for preparation of a credit memo after approval by a responsible supervisor who is independent of the Sales Department.' },

 { id:2064, q:'Which one of the following situations represents an internal control weakness in the payroll department?',
 options:[
 ' A. Payroll department personnel are rotated in their duties.',
 ' B. Paychecks are distributed by the employees&#8217; immediate supervisor.',
 ' C. Payroll records are reconciled with quarterly tax reports.',
 ' D. The timekeeping function is independent of the payroll department.'

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> A voucher should not be prepared for payment until the vendor&#8217;s invoice has been matched against the corresponding purchase order and receiving report. This procedure provides assurance that a valid transaction has occurred and that the parties have agreed on the terms, such as price and quantity.' },

 { id:2067, q:'The frequency of the comparison of recorded accountability with assets (for the purpose of safeguarding assets) should be determined by',
 options:[
 ' A. The amount of assets independent of the cost of the comparison.',

 ' A. Competent personnel.',
 ' B. Segregation of functions.',
 ' C. Supervision.',
 ' D. Asset access limited to authorized personnel.'
 ], answer:2, notID:2070, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (B) is correct.</div> In the usual retail cash sales situation, the sales clerk authorizes and records the transactions and takes custody of assets. However, management ordinarily employs other compensating controls to minimize the effects of the failure to segregate functions. The cash receipts function is closely supervised, cash registers provide limited access to assets, and an internal recording function maintains control over cash receipts.' },

 { id:2071, q:'The procedure that would best discourage the resubmission of vendor invoices after they have been paid is',
 options:[
 ' A. A requirement for double endorsement of checks.',
 ' B. The cancellation of vouchers by accounting personnel.',
 ' C. The cancellation of vouchers by treasurer personnel.',
 ' D. The mailing of payments directly to payees by accounting personnel.'
 ], answer:3, notID:2071, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (C) is correct.</div> Canceling vouchers and supporting papers (with perforations, ink, etc.) upon payment prevents the payment of a duplicate voucher. If the person signing the check does the canceling, the documents cannot be recycled for duplicate payments. Securing the paid-voucher file from access by the accounts payable clerk is another effective control.' },

  { id:2072, q:'Organizational independence in the processing of payroll is achieved by functional separations that are built into the system. Which one of the following functional separations is not required for internal control purposes?',
 options:[
 ' A. Separation of timekeeping from payroll preparation.',

 ' B. The employee could steal securities, and the theft would never be discovered.',
 ' C. It would be impossible to obtain a fidelity bond on the employee.',
 ' D. There would be no record of when company personnel visited the safe-deposit box.'

 options:[
 ' A. Disposal of fully depreciated assets.',

 ' A. The treasurer has the authority to sign checks but gives the signature block to the assistant treasurer to run the check-signing machine.',
 ' B. The warehouse clerk, who has the custodial responsibility over inventory in the warehouse, may authorize disposal of damaged goods.',
 ' C. The sales manager has the responsibility to approve credit and the authority to write off accounts.',
 ' D. The department time clerk is given the undistributed payroll checks to mail to absent employees.'

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (A) is correct.</div> Control procedures include segregation of duties to reduce the risk that any person may be able to perpetrate and conceal errors or fraud in the normal course of his or her duties. Different persons should authorize transactions, record transactions, and maintain custody of assets. The treasurer&#8217;s department should have custody of assets but should not authorize or record transactions. Because the assistant treasurer reports to the treasurer, the treasurer is merely delegating an assigned duty related to asset custody. The use of the check-signing machine does not conflict with any other duty of the assistant treasurer and does not involve authorization or recording of transactions.' },

 { id:2076, q:'If internal control is well designed, two tasks that should be performed by different persons are',
 options:[
 ' A. Approval of bad debt write-offs, and reconciliation of the accounts payable subsidiary ledger and controlling account.',
 ' B. Distribution of payroll checks and approval of sales returns for credit.',

 ' D. Recording of cash receipts and preparation of bank reconciliations.'
 ], answer:4, notID:2076, yourAns: "Not answered", yourNote: "",
  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> Recording of cash establishes accountability for assets. The bank reconciliation compares that recorded accountability with actual assets. The recording of cash receipts and preparation of bank reconciliations should therefore be performed by different individuals since the preparer of a reconciliation could conceal a cash shortage. For example, if a cashier both prepares the bank deposit and performs the reconciliation, (s)he could embezzle cash and conceal the theft by falsifying the reconciliation.' },

  ansExplain: '<div class="ExplnAns">Answer (D) is correct.</div> Having an independent third party prepare the bank reconciliations would reveal any discrepancies between recorded deposits and the bank statements. A bank reconciliation compares the bank statement with company records and resolves differences caused by deposits in transit, outstanding checks, NSF checks, bank charges, errors, etc. The other answer choices are controls implemented before deposits are prepared and recorded in the company&#8217;s books.

The evolution of COBIT has reflected the change in the nature of information technology within the organization. COBIT 5 added five key principles: (1) meeting stakeholder needs; (2) covering the enterprise end to end; (3) applying a single, integrated framework; (4) enabling a holistic approach; and (5) separating governance from management. The latest version, COBIT 2019, expands on COBIT 5&#8217;s key principles to include six governance system principles and three governance framework principles.
